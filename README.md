# Advent of Code 2021

This repository holds my solutions for [AoC 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022). I've chosen Python again to keep practice.

## Prerequisites

* [Python 3](https://python.org)
* [anytree](https://anytree.readthedocs.io/) (`pip install anytree`)

## Run solutions

Run tests:

```
$ python -m unittest
```
